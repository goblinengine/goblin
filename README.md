## Description

[Goblin Engine](https://goblinengine.github.io) is a custom build of [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) created for personal use.

The goal of this project is multifold:
- Make the engine easier to use (primarily aimed at children, students and beginners)
- Make the Engine more visually appealing and more functional (bigger buttons, bigger text, more streamlined controls, less visual clutter)
- Maintain full compatibility with latest Godot 3 branch (any project created in Godot Engine can be opened and edited with Goblin Engine)
- Additional goal is to add useful Godot Engine 3 unapproved PRs or possibly even backport some features of Godot 4 back into 3
