## Description

[Goblin Engine](https://goblinengine.github.io) is a custom build of [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) created for educational and personal use.

The goal of this project is multifold:
- Make the editor more visually appealing, larger controls, and more flexible UI
- Implement useful features from PRs, Godot forks, modules or from GDNative addons (adapted into modules) that can be shipped with the engine
- Maintain full compatibility with latest Godot 3.x branch

Note that at this time Goblin has no releases since is very new. You would need to compile it from scratch yourself for now. 

Goblin is compatible with Godot 3.x but implements some custom functionality that Godot does not have. Some of this functionality overlaps with [Goost Engine](https://goostengine.github.io/).

Please have a look at list of [Goblin Changes](https://github.com/goblinengine/goblin/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to find out more.
