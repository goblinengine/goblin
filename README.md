## Description

[Goblin Engine](https://goblinengine.github.io) is a custom build of [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) created for educational and personal use.

Goblin aims to maintain full compatibility with latest Godot 3 branch. Any project created in Godot 3.x can be opened and edited in Goblin but not vice versa.

The project aims to implement features from PRs or Godot forks, backport features from Godot 4, 

Goblin implements some custon functionality:
  - Ability to import external shader adapted from work by iFire and Lyuma
  - New random generator functions including ability to shuffle, pick random choice or roll dice (some of which was adapted from [Goost Engine](https://goostengine.github.io)
  - Ability to use indexed images and palettes (slower but more convenient than shaders) implemented by Xrayez in [Goost Engine](https://goostengine.github.io)
