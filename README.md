## Description

[Goblin Engine](https://goblinengine.github.io) is a custom build of [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) created for educational and personal use.

The goal of this project is multifold:
- Make the engine more visually functional and flexible
- Implement features from PRs or Godot forks aimed for educational (and soe power use)
- Add new useful modules
- Attempt to optimize some aspects of the engine
- Potentially backport some functionality from Godot
- Ideally keep engine size small as much as possible
- Goblin aims to maintain full compatibility with latest Godot 3 branch

Note that at this time Goblin has no releases since is very new. You would need to compile it from scratch yourself. 

Goblin implements some custom functionality:
  - Ability to import external shader adapted from work by iFire and Lyuma
  - New random generator functions including ability to shuffle, pick random choice or roll dice (some of which was adapted from [Goost Engine](https://goostengine.github.io)
  - Ability to use indexed images and palettes (slower but more convenient than shaders) implemented by Xrayez in [Goost Engine](https://goostengine.github.io)
