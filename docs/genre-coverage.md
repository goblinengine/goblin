# Genre Coverage — Needs × Godot × Fork Plan

Date: 2026-08-15. Analysis of every genre in the vision against what Godot 4.7.x offers natively and what the fork must provide. Companion to `ROADMAP.md` §1 (vision) and `backlog.md`.

Legend: **overlap** = Godot covers it (scriptable where noted) · **gap → item** = fork plan item (backlog ID).

---

## 1. FPS

| Need | Godot offers | Godot lacks → fork |
|---|---|---|
| Movement (walk/sprint/crouch/jump/slide) | CharacterBody3D + `move_and_slide`, FOV, mouse capture | — scriptable |
| Camera (headbob, shake, ADS) | Camera3D, Tween, AnimationPlayer | — scriptable |
| Hitscan weapons | RayCast3D, `intersect_ray`, shape queries | **Impact surface metadata** (class, UV, material) → M-09 |
| Projectiles | RigidBody3D, particles | — scriptable |
| Damage/health/location | Area3D hitboxes | No native framework → scriptable (title-side) |
| Decals, tracers, muzzle flash | Decal node, GPUParticles3D | — scriptable |
| Enemy AI | NavigationAgent3D/Region3D/Obstacle3D, RVO avoidance | Cover AI → scriptable |
| Many enemies perf | — | **GDScript hot paths** → G-10/G-11 |

**Verdict:** Godot covers ~90% of FPS mechanics. One real engine gap (hitscan metadata), one perf gap (planned).

## 2. RPG

| Need | Godot offers | Godot lacks → fork |
|---|---|---|
| Items/quests/dialogue data | Resource system, JSON, ConfigFile | No data-table framework → **G-08 typed dicts, G-07 structs** (G-18 template dicts engine-side rejected 2026-08-19 — templates are a GDScript-side registry pattern, see `data.gd`; residual `Dictionary` perf gating is TD-04) |
| Inventory/containers/shops | Full Control UI toolkit | No native system → scriptable (title-side) |
| Stats/levels/skill trees | — | Scriptable |
| Dialogue | Dialogic (community addon) | Scriptable (title-side) |
| Quests/objectives | Signals, groups | Scriptable (title-side) |
| **Entity model as data** | Dictionary is untyped, copy-by-ref | **G-07 structs** (kills 60+ `duplicate(true)`), typed containers |
| Save/load world state | ResourceSaver, manual serialization | No systemic save framework → title-side delta save/load (adopted) |
| Rules/condition eval | — | Scriptable (title-side Rule) — C++ reaction server correctly rejected |

**Verdict:** RPG is a *data-layer* genre. Godot's language gap (untyped dicts, no value types) is the whole story → G-07/G-08 are exactly the right answer. (Engine-level template dicts G-18 rejected 2026-08-19 — templates live GDScript-side, see `data.gd`; residual `Dictionary` perf gating is TD-04.)

## 3. Shooter (general/TPS/arena)

| Need | Godot offers | Godot lacks → fork |
|---|---|---|
| Third-person camera | SpringArm3D (native!) | — |
| Networking (if multiplayer) | High-level multiplayer, ENet/WebSocket/WebRTC modules (kept) | — |
| Everything else | Same as FPS | Same as FPS |

**Verdict:** Fully covered. No fork work beyond FPS items.

## 4. Boomer Shooter

| Need | Godot offers | Godot lacks → fork |
|---|---|---|
| Static baked lighting | LightmapGI + LightmapperRD (editor-only) | **Runtime CPU baking on GLES3** → C-02 `lightmapper_cpu`; culling bug fix C-01; editor pipeline C-11 |
| **Lightstyles** (animated baked light flicker) | — | Nothing → **M-11** |
| **Palette/indexed color** | — | Nothing → **M-06, M-12** |
| Texture animation / color cycling | Shader TIME (scriptable) | Editor-friendly nodes → M-13 |
| Pixel-perfect scaling | Nearest/integer stretch | **CUT1/2 upscalers (DONE)** |
| **Kinematic movers** (doors/lifts/crushers) | AnimatableBody3D (carries player) | Blocking policy, crush damage, deterministic order → **M-10** |
| Hitscan metadata | — | Same as FPS → M-09 |
| Level geometry | Scene-based (no BSP — fine) | Title converts sectors → ArrayMesh |
| PVS/occlusion | Occluder3D + baked occlusion | — covered |
| Dither/CRT/post | Canvas shaders | Scriptable (title-side) |

**Verdict:** Boomer shooter is where the *retro presentation* gaps concentrate — lightstyles, palettes, texture animation — plus the mover contract. All planned, all currently P3.

## 5. Immersive Sim

| Need | Godot offers | Godot lacks → fork |
|---|---|---|
| Physics manipulation (pickup/throw/stack) | RigidBody3D, joints, impulses — **strong** | — |
| **Interaction** (verbs, prompts, focus) | Area3D + input_pickable (raw) | No interaction contract → title-side scripted; no migration case yet |
| **Light perception / AI visibility** | Raycasts only | **No light field** → C-05/M-07 + M-08 stealth value (Thief light gem) |
| **Audio occlusion/propagation** | AudioStreamPlayer3D + reverb bus | No occlusion, no portal re-emission → **C-06** |
| Lock/key, doors, levers | Area3D + scripts | Mover semantics → M-10 |
| Portals/spatial weirdness | SubViewport + teleport (manual); Portal/Room nodes are culling-only | Real traversal portals → **M-05** |
| NPC schedules/cadence | `_process`, SceneTreeTimer | Native cadence → title-side scheduler (adopted; native rejected) |
| Systemic state save | — | Title-side delta save/load (adopted) |

**Verdict:** Immersive sim is the fork's *primary focus* — its three genuine gaps (perception fields, audio occlusion, portals) are all planned, but perception + occlusion sit at P2 and portals at P3. **This is the cluster where priority is wrong.**

## 6. Systemic Game

| Need | Godot offers | Godot lacks → fork |
|---|---|---|
| Events/stimulus | Signals, groups, autoloads | No global bus — signals + title-side queue suffice (reaction server rejected correctly) |
| Data-driven rules | Resources + GDScript | No rule engine — title-side; language layer helps (G-19 callable shorthand) |
| **Entity data model** | Nodes | Untyped dicts → **G-17 (DONE), G-08, G-07** (G-18 engine templates rejected 2026-08-19 — see `data.gd`) |
| Perception fields (light/acoustics) | — | → C-05/M-07/M-08, C-06 |
| Tick/cadence scheduling | `process_mode`, custom groups via script | Native cadence rejected; title-side scheduler |
| Determinism | Per-version, no guarantees | Not planned (no rollback need) |
| Procedural content | noise module (kept) | — |
| Simulation glue (timers, tweens) | SceneTreeTimer, Tween — **native** | — |

**Verdict:** Godot's glue (signals/timers/tweens) covers the plumbing. The genuine systemic gaps are the **data layer** (planned, P1) and **perception fields** (planned, P2).

## 7. Low-Fi/Retro (presentation)

| Need | Godot offers | Godot lacks → fork |
|---|---|---|
| GL Compatibility renderer | GLES3 — **native** (kept, primary target) | — |
| Pixel-art upscaling | Nearest/integer scaling | **CUT1/2 (DONE)** |
| Palettes / indexed color | — | → M-06/M-12 |
| Dithering, posterization | Canvas shaders | Scriptable / M-06 editor nodes |
| Color cycling, texture anim | Shader TIME | → M-13 |
| **Low-fi audio (chiptune/MIDI)** | WAV only | **MIDI module (DONE)** — TinySoundFont, importers |
| Low-res rendering | Viewport scaling, SubViewport — native | — |
| Fog, retro atmosphere | Environment fog — native | — |
| Lightmaps | LightmapGI (RD, editor) | Runtime CPU bake → C-02 |

**Verdict:** Godot natively covers most retro *presentation plumbing*; the true gaps are palettes + color-cycling nodes (planned, P3) and the fork already shipped the two biggest retro wins (CUT, MIDI).

# Synthesis

Godot covers the mechanics layer almost completely — movement, physics sandbox, UI, audio, animation, navigation, occlusion, viewport scaling, networking. That overlap is why a *soft fork* is right: don't rebuild what Godot does well.

The genuine gaps cluster in exactly 4 places, and the plan already targets all 4:

| Cluster | Items | Plan status |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Language data layer** (systemic/RPG core) | G-17 done · G-07, G-08 | ✅ P1, correctly prioritized · **Updated 2026-08-19:** G-18 (engine-level template dicts) rejected — templates are a GDScript-side registry pattern proven by `data.gd` (`instance → Objects.list[id] → _types[type].defaults`, keyed by `id`/`type`); no `_template` key in `Variant` (leaks into `keys()`/`merge()`/`size()`/`hash()`/`==` + `core/variant` header blast radius). Residual G-18 value = `Dictionary` runtime-perf hardening under real fallback usage (TD-04 gates any C++ work). G-07/G-08 remain the live language-data items |
| 2. **Perception/simulation fields** (immersive sim + systemic) | C-05/C-06/M-07/M-08 folded → **SimServer S-01/S-02/S-03** (`modules/goblin/docs/rfc/simserver-rfc.md`, 2026-08-16) | ✅ P1 — now the primary-focus pillar with real engine items |
| 3. **Retro presentation** (boomer + low-fi) | CUT done · M-06/M-11/M-12/M-13 | ⚠️ P3 — retro is secondary by charter |
| 4. **Genre contracts** (hitscan metadata → S-02, movers, portals) | M-09 folded → S-02 · M-10/M-05 | ⚠️ P3 — title has scripted substitutes |

**Conclusion:** nothing is missing from the plan. The only real question is priority: **cluster 2 (perception fields) deserves P1** — it is the one cluster where the primary focus has zero delivered substance, and it has no title-side substitute (the viewport-based light sensor is explicitly not scalable). **Resolved 2026-08-16:** cluster 2 is now SimServer (S-01/S-02/S-03, P1) per `docs/rfc/simserver-rfc.md`. Clusters 3–4 stay P3 honestly: the title's scripted solutions work today and retro is secondary.

Recommended adjustments (2026-08-15 alignment review):

1. Charter wording: narrow the "Systemic out of the box" promise to what is actually built (perception fields, occlusion, data layer); interaction/cadence explicitly title-side until a migration case exists. **Resolved 2026-08-16:** no narrowing needed — SimServer gives interaction/cadence/stimulus/fields real engine items (S-01…S-04).
2. Promote C-05/M-07/M-08 (spatial field + stealth value) to P1 after G-18. **Resolved 2026-08-16:** folded into SimServer S-01/S-03, P1. **Note 2026-08-19:** the "after G-18" sequencing is moot — G-18 (engine template dicts) was rejected, so it is no longer a cluster-1 ordering gate; cluster 2 is independently P1 (S-01/S-02/S-03 shipped).
3. Start G-07 structs de-risk (50 parser-only test cases) — pure analysis, unblocks the biggest-gap decision. **Grounded 2026-08-19** by `data.gd`: the reference title's `Data` entity model is dict-heavy with 8+ `duplicate(true)` sites and no value/copy-by-value semantics anywhere — structs are the live language-data gap.
4. Schedule palettes (M-06, 2–3d) or drop the word from the charter.
5. Perf validation gate for G-10/G-11 — profile the reference title first, port only the winning opcodes.
6. P3 hygiene: each P3 item gets a "build if / kill if" line; networking + platform keeps recorded as user-directed exceptions in the charter.
